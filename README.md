# Spelling_Corrector_NLP
******************************************************************************************************************************************
With the use of textblob library in Python, we can easily create Machine Learning Models for the task of Spelling Corrections. Detecting actual word spelling errors is a much more difficult task, as any word in the input text can be an error. 

However, it is possible to use the noisy channel to find candidates for every word the user typed and rank the correction that was probably the userâ€™s original intention
